    <h3>Front-end developer in Cincinnati, Ohio</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        I am from Northern Kentucky but I moved to Cincinnati for college. I love it in Ohio
        because it feels like a mix of a big city while not having all the
        negative aspects of a big city. Cincinnati has oppurtunity for everyone
        and is very inclusive! I have a lot of friends in different businesses around Cincinnati and there really is a place for everyone. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I think Cincinnati is on the rise of cities in America. I will be
        finishing SheCodes here in a few weeks and I am excited to start a
        career in or around Cincinnati I will love! I am passionate about coding and software and development. I am intrigued by this career and excited to learn more and progress with a company that will inspire me to do more and be better than I already am.

      <p>
        Although I have not been professionally coding long, I have taken coding courses and have been exposed to it for a few years. Through my time at the University of Cincinnati I took a few coding courses and then when I started working I was intrigued by the inside work developers and engineers do. I think that I have a lot to offer in a professional wokr space with coding. I am young and excited and adapt to anything thrown my way, quickly and efficiently. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I look forward to a career in software and I want to learn more. In the past six months I have learned so much about the aspects that go into creating something and I hope to now be a successful creator. I look forward to working with new people and developing not only great things - but great professional relationships too!
