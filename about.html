    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>Front-end developer from Cincinnati, Ohio</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        I am from Kentucky but I moved to Ohio for college. I love it in Ohio
        because it feels like a mix of a big city while not having all the
        negative aspects of a big city. Cincinnati has oppurtunity for everyone
        and is very inclusive.
        <br />
        <br />
        I think Cincinnati is on the rise of cities in America. I will be
        finishing SheCodes here in a few weeks and I am excited to start a
        career in Cincinnati I will love!
